A proposition is a declarative sentence ( declares a fact).
What time is it ?
Read this carefully.
x+1=2
x+y=z 
--> not proposition.
Use letters to denote propositional variables -->Proposition that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler porpositions are called atomic propositions.
The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the propositional calculus or propositional logic.
Compound propositions are formed from existing propositions using logical operators
Conjunction : AND
DISJUNCTION : OR
exclusive: only one of p or Q is true. Can have a or b but not both

Biconditional : p,q cung dung hoac cung sai thi true :p if and only if q (p <-->q) (p is necessary and sufficient for q

p-->q : P us called the hypothesis (or antecedent or premise) and q is called the conclusion(or consequence.)
Neu
P true ,q false ==> p-->q false
P true,q true ==> p--> true
p false, q whatever --> p-->q true

There are three types of conditional statements:
_ converse of p--> q is q--> p
_ The contrapositive of p-->q is the proposition -q--> -p
_ -p-->-q is called the inverse of p--> q.
When the original p--> q is false, the contrapositive is true too, but the converse and the inverse are true.
When two compound propositions always have the same truth values, regardless of the truth values of its propositional variables, we call them equivalent
Converse or the inverse of a conditional statement are not equivalent to the original conditional statement.
